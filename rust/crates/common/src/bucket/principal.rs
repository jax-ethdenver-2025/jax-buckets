/**
 * Principals
 * ==========
 * Principals are a fancy name for public keys that
 *  have permissions on the bucket.
 * Principals:
 *  - descrive a public key
 *  - which has a role on the bucket (for now we just support 'owner')
 *  - and have a share into the bucket's encryption key
 * To be clear:
 *  - there is no cryptographic validation of the role *other* than
 *     whether or not clients are willing to accept updates given
 *     the prior state of a bucket. It is the responsibility of clients
 *     to check that bucket updates respect principal roles at a given
 *     update
 *  - shares may be assumed to point to the entry of a bucket for
 *     each principal. It is the responsibility of the updater to
 *     share to all principals st they may read the bucket
